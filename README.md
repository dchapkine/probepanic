What is this?
-------------

Simple bomber-man like game prototype written in 600 lines of pure js and few lines of html5/css3.


It is more a proof of concept than a real project, and the code does NOT even try to be clean or beautiful :)


The only purpose of this was to learn and experiment with new js apis like the canvas 2d api.



Controls
-------

Arrow keys to move ( you can move move diagonally too )

Space to drop bomb (probes and photon canons can be destroyed)


Assets
------

I did NOT created graphical assets. They come from starcraft 2 ;)
